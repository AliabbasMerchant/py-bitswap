constants.js - mostly timeout constants


Dependencies:
async                   ✔️ Use the built-in `asyncio` module (Python 3.5+)
bignum                  ✔️ builtin (use the standard `int` type of Python 3.x)
cids                    ✔️ py-cid (Module is ready for prime-time)
debug                   ✔️ Use the built-in `logging` module for the time being
ipfs-block              ✔️ Trivial, add as part of `py-bitswap` or extract to utility library if needed by several modules
just-debounce-it        ✖️ Trivial, add as part of `py-bitswap` or extract to utility library if needed by several modules
lodash.isequalwith      ✔️ Use Python's inbuilt `==` operator 😉 – ensure all relevant classes implement `__eq__`
moving-average          ~ Use https://pypi.org/project/average/ – It will need a patch to make numpy integration optional through
multicodec              ✔️ py-multicodec
multihashing-async      ~ py-multihash (+ Extensions for generating actual hash values)
protons                 ✔️ protobuf
pull-length-prefixed    ✖️ Probably better suited as an extension for the `varint` library
pull-stream             ✔️ Not needed. Use asyncio streams (https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-stream.html) instead
varint-decoder          ~ varint

✔️ means “Already done, no further work required”
~     means “Available, but may need further work”
✖️ means “Not done yet”
