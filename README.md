# py-ipfs-bitswap
Python implementation of the Bitswap 'data exchange' protocol used by IPFS 

## Work in Progress
Currently, I am referring to the [js-ipfs-bitswap](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-bitswap) repo,
and am trying to replicate its functionality.   
I am documenting all my findings in the folder [research](research).
